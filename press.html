		<p>"The lead track from their upcoming debut LP 'Super Genuine' explores the intricacies and frustrations of intimacy and the consequences of sharing your heart. 'You had to tell me the way around your weakness / instead of finding the reason for your hardship,' sings Hoop, with airy vocals and layered harmonies. Heartbreak and hardship go hand in hand, pain and acceptance intertwine – it’s fitting, somehow, that a marlin spike is a sharp pointed tool used in marine rope work for disentangling knots. Unsettling and calming all at once, the song reflects just how hopelessly complicated yet how shockingly simple life can sometimes seem."<a href="http://www.thegreyestates.com/blog/mp3-marlin-spike-hoop" target="_blank" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">-Sarah Hojsak, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Grey Estates</span>.</a></p>

		<p>"[...] though [Marlin Spike] feels tranquil, Roberts is singing about a relationship that's anything but easy."<a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1932045/hoop-marlin-spike/premiere/" target="_blank" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">-James Rettig, Stereogum.</a></p>

		<p>“When I first saw Hoop, all that kept running through my head was a constant stream of 'Wow, I love this band.'' Caitlin Roberts, Leena Joshi, and Pamela Santiago trade off singing on the dreamiest friendship-bracelet pop songs, full of tender harmonies and magical guitar lines and introspective lyrics that tug gently on my most sensitive heart strings.” <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/events/23630719/hoop-pets-and-slashed-tires" target ="_blank" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">-Robin Edwards, <span style="font-style:italic">The Stranger</span>.</a></p>

		<p>“Recently a friend hipped me to the confusing Tumblr style 'soft grunge.'' I’m still not entirely sure anyone knows what 'soft grunge' means, but the incredibly cool 'To Know Your Tone' by local DIY supergroup Hoop is probably the closest I’ve come to it. The contrast of guest vocalist Allyson Foster’s Zen cooing over the subdued, distorting guitar chugging below it is brilliant, and treads some genuinely new and exciting tonal ground. Check out the elusive group as it headlines a night opened by one of its frequent collaborators, the ethereal, vocal-looping Briana Marela.” -Kelton Sears, <span style="font-style: italic">Seattle Weekly</span>.</p>

		<p>"Hoop has a nostalgic garage feel to their music with lyrics that strike home about the intimate feelings we experience throughout every day life and in relationships by way of fuzzy guitars and beautiful melodies. Expect to be swooned over by this playful but serious band." <a href="http://tomtommag.com/2016/09/gnar-babes/" target="_blank" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">-Miro Justad, <span style="font-style:italic">Tom Tom Magazine</span>.</a></p>

		<p>"The quartet Hoop celebrate an egalitarian approach to songwriting and art. Their solo release, Dream Split, is a split with Gar Pal. Only, Gar Pal includes all the members of Hoop. Drummer and vocalist Leena Joshi also includes a spoken word piece on the record. On the Hoop recordings, each member shares the vocals alongside their instrumental duties. Not only does this keep the music diverse, but it also exemplifies the importance of giving every woman a voice – quite literally." <a href="http://www.preampmusic.com/2016/10/04/preamp-suggests-mommy-long-legs-hoop-kelli-frances-corrado-and-scifisol-at-the-sunset-tavern-106/" target="_blank">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style="background-color:#FFFFFF">-Dusty Henry, <i>Pre/Amp.</i></span></a></p>

		<p>“I usually only listen to metal, but I am really into this band.” <a href="http://www.decencyden.com/meme.html" target="_blank" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">-Some Sound Guy</a></p>
